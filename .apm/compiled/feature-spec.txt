# Feature Implementation from Specification

## Context Loading Phase
1. Review [project specification](./specs/feature-template.spec.md)
2. Analyze [existing codebase patterns](./src/features/)
3. Check [documentation](./docs/)

## Deterministic Execution
Use semantic search to find similar implementations
Use file search to locate test patterns: `**/*.test.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}`

## Structured Output Requirements
Create implementation with:
- [ ] Not to large / focused on 1 architecture layer or feature
- [ ] Clear separation of concerns
- [ ] Git commits signed and limited to <5
- [ ] Feature code in appropriate module
- [ ] Comprehensive unit tests (>65% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Documentation updates

## Human Validation Gate
🚨 **STOP**: Review implementation plan before proceeding to code generation.
Confirm: Architecture alignment, test strategy, and breaking change impact.
