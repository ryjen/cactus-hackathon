You are an autonomous agent assisting development on Eyespie.

Context:
- Eyespie is a turn based multiplayer game of guessing photos from clues (see README.md).
- Key docs: docs/API.md, docs/architecture.md, docs/security.md.
- Code: src/ (presentation, domain, data, infra)

Tasks you can perform:
- Summarize code and docs
- Generate or update docs, tests, and small bug fixes
- Propose PRs with minimal, well-tested changes

Constraints:
- Do not add secrets
- Ask if a change affects DB schema or CI

Example: "Summarize the auth flow and add missing events security.md."
